# DesignPatterns App (SwiftUI + Clean Architecture) - currently WIP

This is a demo iOS application built with **SwiftUI** that demonstrates the **real-world use of software design patterns** in a clean, modular architecture.

The application was created with the goal of showcasing:
- Practical usage of **creational**, **structural**, and **behavioral** design patterns
- Clean, testable architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Scalable data layer with support for multiple data sources
- Async data flow and Swift concurrency in SwiftUI

> All the patterns listed in the UI are **actually implemented in the codebase** and govern the core architecture of the app.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸ“‹ **List of software design patterns**, categorized by type
- ðŸš¦ **State-driven UI** using a generic `UIState<T>` enum
- ðŸš€ Fully **asynchronous logic** using `async/await`
- ðŸŽ¯ SwiftUI + MVVM + DI-ready
- ðŸ’¡ Custom overlay with animation to display pattern details
- ðŸŽ¨ Visual styling based on pattern type (emoji, color, icon)

## ðŸ§© Design Patterns Applied in Codebase

| Pattern              | Type         | Where Itâ€™s Used                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Builder**          | Creational   | Constructing `DesignPattern` models safely and incrementally     |
| **Abstract Factory** | Creational   | Switching between mock and API data sources                      |
| **Specification**    | Behavioral   | Filtering patterns by name/type with composable specifications   |

You can find all patterns in action inside:
- `UseCase/`, `Repositories/`, `Specifications/`, and `Utilities/` folders.
